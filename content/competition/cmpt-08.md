## 答疑补遗文件（四） 

## Supplementary and Q&A Document IV

档案馆项建中提到的中小学档案及爱国主义教育基地属于燃气管线范围内的特定场所，用地安全评价分析单位建议中小学档案及爱国主义教育基地尽量远离燃气管道一侧，最小为200米范围外。方志馆属于重要公共区域，也尽量远离。

The Archives and Patriotism Education Base in Primary and Secondary Schools mentioned in the Archives Project Proposal are specific places within the gas pipeline. The Land Use Safety Evaluation and Analysis Agency recommends that the Archives and Patriotism Education Base in Primary and Secondary Schools should be as far away as possible from the side of the gas pipeline, at least 200 meters away. The Local Chronicles Museum is an important public area, and it should be kept as far away from gas pipelines as possible.
