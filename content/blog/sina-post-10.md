A former vice-chief urban planner of the Urban Planning
and Land Resource Commission of Shenzhen’s municipal government,
Weiwen Huang is the director of Shenzhen Center for Public Art
and Shenzhen Center for Design, which are
both affiliated with the commission. The former main organizer of
the Hong Kong &amp; Shenzhen Bi-city Biennale of
Urbanism\Architecture, Huang was a 2010 Loeb Fellow at Harvard
University’s Graduate School of Design. He spoke with Mi You about
Shenzhen's urbanization "miracle" and what the future may hold for
the city.

What is the driving force and logic behind
Shenzhen’s urban development?

&#8203;Weiwen
Huang: Shenzhen was founded in
1979, and, in 1980, it was designated as China’s first Special
Economic Zone within the framework of China’s open reform policies.
By 2010, its population had increased thirty fold, with a yearly
increase of 12 percent [permanent residents now total 10.36 million
and actual residents more than 14 million].
This development could be regarded as a miracle in human
urbanization history. Yet the driving force and logic is never
complicated: It is a most intensive explosion of the long
suppressed social energy in China.
Just one river away from Shenzhen, Hong Kong posed a
strong contrast [to China’s closed economy]. It prospered under
British administration’s liberal market economy. This was reason
enough for almost one million Mainland Chinese to risk their lives
to cross the border to Hong Kong. Having realized this problem,
Deng Xiaoping, then leader of China, pushed forward the economic
reform scheme in 1978, and picked Shenzhen as the lab for
experiment. Shenzhen would open up to Hong Kong’s capital, as well
as its technological and managerial expertise.
The “Shenzhen miracle” emerged naturally when the
suppressions were removed: Farmers are allowed to nurture crops of
their own choice, and they are also
untiedfrom their land and allowed to move.
Factory workers get paid for the amount they produce. Entrepreneurs
may launch production based on market need. The market allows
relative free circulation of means of production and pricing of
products. When Hong Kong, with its accumulated capital and
expertise, met with the vast sources of cheap labor and land in
Shenzhen, it created the pathway for China’s rapid
globalization.
What are the so-called “urban villages” in
Shenzhen? What is the logic and form of their
development?
Huang:
The urban village in
Shenzhen is a development initiated by villagers who originally
live on land that is surrounded by urban developments. The urban
developments come, in turn, from a nationalization of rural land,
or land owned collectively by villagers, a process during which the
value of land increases. Villagers own the land collectively, while
“urban land” belongs to the state, thus the phenomenon of two modes
of development in a rapidly urbanizing city like Shenzhen. The
smallest unit of urban village development is the one-hundred-
square-meter homestead to which a villager family is entitled, and
on which they may develop houses. Or the village may develop
factory, commercial, or residential estates collectively.
Typically, urban villages are highly dense—one house can stand one
to eight meters from the neighboring house. They are not approved
through official procedure for urban development, architectural
design, quality control, or ownership registration. Rental [prices]
remain low, which are ideal for newcomers to the city and lower-end
businesses. Infrastructure and management tasks are undertaken by a
collectively owned village company, which enjoys relative community
autonomy.

The will of this kind of development comes from villagers
taking initiative to participate in urbanization, and to gain their
piece of the pie from it. The villagers adjust the density of this
self-initiated development based on market needs. The urban
village, in effect, acts as a complement to urban planning and
urban management. It helps as a housing supplement, so slums don’t
necessarily arise in the face of overwhelming numbers of newcomers
to the city, and it could even serve as social housing estates for
the middle and lower class. The pedestrian village culture is
transformed into a urban principle that allows carrying out daily
routines—connections to other urban centers and commercial and
industrial areas —within walking distance, thus contributing to the
relief of a worsening transportation situation.
The urban village as another kind of infrastructure for
Shenzhen has not been fully and objectively discussed. Its extreme
density and unsatisfying safety codes and living
conditions, together with the desire to
create ever more profit on the part of bigger capital holders, have
led to the total erasure of some urban villages. Although the
original villagers may have enjoyed sizable compensation from the
developers—many became millionaires—the rights of tenants and the
vibrant urban life they create are disregarded. John Friedmann, a
scholar of urban planning, once remarked that urban villages
represent the true characteristics of Shenzhen better than the
planned urban spaces that are without much human touch.
What kinds of mobility will Shenzhen need in
the future?
Huang: I
mentioned the development logic of Shenzhen itself and the self-
development of urban villages in Shenzhen. This achievement is
built on the mobility of people and capital. Shenzhen is the first
success story because of its unique geopolitical situation with
both a border to Hong Kong and a border to Mainland China, and the
mobility between these borders. The sustainable development of
Shenzhen means, in a time when the world cannot be flat and there
will remain geographical and political borders, to transform
difference into impetus for mobility, and to create better
conditions for this mobility.

What does the future of Shenzhen look like? What role
will its residents play? Huang: As a longstanding
practitioner in the field of urban planning, I know enough not to
give any projection of the future. Urban planners in Chinese
fashion love to grant the future city grand titles: modern,
international city, pioneering, or model city. In my view, urban
planning has to move away from grand visions and into research on
livability and sustainability of cities. Residents should be
enabled, through regulations, to participate in urban development,
in a tangible way such as that of the villagers in urban villages.
In Shenzhen and elsewhere in China, the players have been largely
reduced to two: the government and the big real-estate developers.
But they are not the users of the city, nor are they the subjects
of urban life. The separation of subjects of urban construction and
urban life will inevitably lead to the separation of physical space
and real life.
What might be the impact of information
networks that are transparent and integrated into different facets
of urban life?

Huang:We
could never overestimate the impact of information on future
cities. The term “digital city” has been used by Shenzhen
officials; the first step toward it seems to be implementation of
citywide free Wi-Fi hotspots. I don’t know what qualifies a city as
an “information city,” but I could say, if it could be realized
elsewhere in the world, it wouldn’t take too long for Shenzhen to
catch up. Shenzhen is, after all, a city with a majority of young
people, and a city that has successfully transformed itself from a
manufacturer town to a city that embraces high-tech
industries.
