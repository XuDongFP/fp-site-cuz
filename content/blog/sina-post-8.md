translated by Huang Xiangjun

The development of real estate and the growth of a city
are blindsided by each other. They suffer from a lack of
integration.There are countless
expert forums and media commentaries on issues of real estate
development, and as many researchers and scholars debating about
urban planning issues. Yet they seem to only have the capacity to
discuss the respective topics within their own fields, failing to
bring the two subjects together. The intersection of these two
fields can offer a fertile ground for new research if the scholars
can refocus their perspectives and interests. Developers in China
should be well aware that they are the real builders of a city,
with approximately half of the city within their grasp. Chinese
urban planners should be cognizant of the operations of real estate
development, in order to appreciate how good urban planning can be
realized. Only when the real motivations behind real estate
development are understood, can it become a constructive force
behind the design and planning of cities in China.

From Self-Organized and Communal to the Commodity
Market
Before the advent of modern real estate development,
residential architecture was self-organized and privately built. To
build a residence prior to the professionalization of the field,
one needed to seek help from neighbors, friends and relatives, or
assemble a team of expert laborers and artisans. Once a prospective
building owner has a comprehensive knowledge of the local climate,
materials and cultural practices, it would lead to an appropriate
form of architecture. These common houses would aggregate to form a
compact city, within which the architecture would be tight-knit and
of the same vernacular typology. Examples include the siheyuan
courtyard houses of old Beijing, or the Naxi houses of old Lijiang.
The era of self-constructed houses in Chinese cities may well have
ended when the last dingzihu “nail house” is removed. There is
often a strong sense of attachment to such self-made homes, hence
stories of resistance against urban redevelopment in China are not
uncommon. In modern planning, big developers and real estate
conglomerates have replaced the individual home builders. They
organize, plan, design, and construct houses and apartments on a
large scale in highly repetitive and mechanized forms. There are
also constructions funded by the public sector, such as government
office buildings, public institutions, infrastructure systems, and
large scale social housing. The forces that used to shape a city
have shriveled from a vibrant, multi-dimensional and participatory
one to a bipolar condition of the government and private
developer.

Comprehensive System and Subsidies
The issue of large-scale market and social housing must be
approached in terms of policy and strategy. More studies must be
conducted on land policy, funding, distribution, and circulation,
such that design can be better informed. In the fields of urban
planning and architectural design, suggestions can only be made in
the context of existing standards, and in terms of gradual
improvements. Taking Shenzhen as an example, the housing market
once had a long period of stability, where every household had a
shelter because there was a comprehensive housing supply system
that catered to a population with a broad range of income
levels.
Resettlement areas built in the earlier stages of urban
development, and the coexistence of dense urban villages serve as a
form of social security in terms of affordable housing for
populations with low income. Even though such housing were supplied
by the market, the government played a role in subsidizing them.
The land on which the farmers in the urban villages had built their
homes were made available cheaply.

Higher up the housing market chain, there were low-profit
housing being constructed and managed by the municipal government.
These homes had selling and rental prices that were lower than the
market price, but higher than that of welfare housing. Welfare
housing were only available to senior staff working in state-owned
companies and enterprises. Such employees represent the
middle-income class, and the housing security they are entitled to
is part of a reward structure. Lastly, unsubsidized market housing
is available for the general public with high income. These
different tiers of housing formed a relatively comprehensive and
complete housing supply system, and it gave stability to the entire
housing situation in Shenzhen. Unfortunately, the housing
department in Shenzhen was dissolved in 2004 due to new policies
passed by the State Council of the People's Republic of China.
There was a push to privatize and commodify housing at a national
level, leading to imbalances in housing distribution and
skyrocketing prices.

Structural Imbalance and Shortage
There are multiple reasons for the increase in housing
prices. Shortage of the provision of subsidies and social housing
is just one of them. Based on the total housing supply in China,
the urban living space per capita is 30 square meters, which is
equivalent to a moderately developed country. The living space per
capita for Shenzhen is even higher at 40 square meters. The “house
shortage” problem is therefore an issue of structural imbalance,
not that there is an actual shortage in supply, or a lack of
housing units. Many existing housing units remain sold but
unoccupied. In order to provide a shelter for every household,
policy-makers first need to ensure that housing can be maximized
and occupied. The correct remedy to the problem is not to build
more housing, but to improve the distribution of the existing
in-stock housing such that vacant housing can be occupied by those
in need of housing.

Low-Income Communities
To tackle some of the housing issues in China, one has to
have a vivid awareness of the lives of the low-income community.
Some of them are street vendors selling goods on their mobile
stalls, others may render informal services for a small community.
To the urban poor, a home is not just a place to sleep, but also a
place to work and live. For example, the Yuanlin neighborhood in
the city of Shenzhen used to be a welfare housing community with
excellent architectural and neighborhood design. But as the
original residents moved out over time, it evolved into a
low-income neighborhood. It deteriorated from welfare housing for
the middle-income to affordable housing for the low-income. Media
reports suggested that the environment in Yuanlin was considered by
the government to be slum-like &ndash; walls in the
housing units were torn down to make storefronts, and informal
street stalls were set up without permission. Multiple municipal
departments were called upon to rectify these issues.

In a city undergoing constant transformation, the
expectation and mentality of an orderly neighborhood with an
aesthetic outlook is unrealistic, if not deeply problematic. For a
community that had been transformed by newer low-income residents,
the reconfigurations in the housing fabric were made in order to
meet the basic daily needs of its residents. The living standards
of a low-income group are bound to be different from that of the
middle-income, therefore it is not appropriate to simply use urban
policy to turn Yuanlin back into a tidy and clean neighborhood. Due
to complex problems at the level of policy-making, planners and
architects should think of the issue of large-scale housing in a
broader way. For example, design solutions are still sorely needed
in terms of the entire housing provision chain. Greater flexibility
in design is required to cater for uncertainty in the demand and
supply of housing, and for a lack of clarity of the target groups
in need of social housing.

Basic Principles of Affordability and
Livability
The design of good social housing is not necessarily
related to a mere sense of aesthetics and artistic concerns. The
greater responsibility is for architects and planners to identify
and study the users, and discover a way to communicate and interact
with them. Architects and planners have to reevaluate existing
professional knowledge and design methods that are currently geared
towards serving commercial clients and interests. Can Chinese
architects return to the basic principles of good housing design?
Can housing be made affordable to the general public again? While
it is ideal to realize affordable housing quickly, it is necessary
to be aware that the process of design cannot be reckless. It is
perhaps timely to accept that patience is required to bring about
improvements. The production of housing in Shenzhen can transform
from a process based on speed to one based on quality. Affordable
housing can be achieved in a more direct and efficient way, if
design can go beyond the meeting of planning requirements
stipulated by code. Design must have an impact on the formulation
of policies and strategies related to funding, land use,
distribution, user needs, location, amenities, unit types,
materials, green technology, in order to attain a higher standard
of housing.

In China, the general public’s aspiration for better
living spaces and a more affordable city can only be realized
through agencies such as governments and developers. Citizens
participation and leadership in the town and community model of
development can no longer exist in China. Hence it is more
meaningful to reestablish the relationship between “real estate”
and the city, instead of “housing” and the city, because real
estate development has become the primary driving force for Chinese
cities today. There are five important roles that real estate in
China has to play towards the creation of a more livable
city.

Genuine Equality
Firstly, there has to be a better accessibility to natural
resources, and an equitable sharing and enjoyment of amenities and
views of landscapes in the city. To use Shanghai as an example, the
early developments of the concessionary period were well planned
and regulated &ndash; a street grid that connected the
city with the scenery of the Bund, viewing the Huangpu River as one
of the main natural landscape features of the city. Compare this to
Lake Xiangmi of Shenzhen, which was one the major tourist
attractions in the past. Today, public access along the eastern
edge of this lake is completely blocked by two large-scale private
housing sites. The real estate advertisements blatantly declared
this exploitation of public resources &ndash; “Hugging
Lake Xiangmi, You Own the Lakeview.” Residents eastward of these
two sites can no longer gain access to the views of the lake, thus
reducing the livability of the city as a whole. This desire to gain
exclusivity over access and views to landscape amenities and
natural resources is commonplace in China.

Openness and Connectivity
Secondly, housing has to enjoy a good degree of openness
in the city, and ease of connectivity of the street networks. In
China, the stakeholders of real estate development have a perverse
enjoyment of the “big fours” &ndash; planners like to
create big urban blocks, governments like to sell big plots of
land, developers like to build on big sites, and consumers like to
live in big gated garden neighborhoods. In the Panyu District of
Guangzhou, housing sites are at least hundreds of acres, fully
secured and privatized with fences and security guards. Residents
have to take private shuttle buses provided by the developers to do
their groceries or watch a movie in the city, often taking half a
day just to leave the gated neighborhood. In the beginning, the
white-collar residents were enthusiastic about moving into these
new “5-star homes.”But with a
lack of urban vitality and connectivity, the residents promptly
returned to the city for their movie theaters, ice cream parlors,
herbal tea stalls, and late-night eateries. They ultimately
preferred the congested but vibrant street life of a
city.

Access to Public Space and Services
Public space and public service are vital to a healthy
community, adding a third aspect to the livability of a city. The
garden environments in private real estates in China are abundantly
branded “5-stars” in advertisements, and covered in exotic plants,
ponds, rocky gardens, and every luxuriant green imaginable. This
green area routinely takes up 50% of a given site area, but
unfortunately, the gardens often have nothing to do with the city
or the public. These gated gardens repeatedly fail to even satisfy
the needs of the elderly and children who reside right next to
them, even when these residents only require a small open space
where they can dance, exercise, bike, and play. There is the issue
of having the right membership to use the space at the right time.
In fact, younger residents who stay up and wake up late would
complain about the elderly for being too loud in their morning
exercise routines. A gated garden or an urban park that is three
bus stops away cannot solve this problem. The public needs an
intelligently located public space that is close to the community.
A thirty to fifty square meter public open space or a 300 square
meter public room &ndash; taking up only 5% of
developable land and 0.3% floor area ratio &ndash; but
adequate in satisfying the requirements for public activities and
services. This shows lush but inaccessible green public spaces do
not necessarily create a harmonious relationship between the
residents, the public and the city.

Social Integration and Reduction of Class
Segregation
Social integration is the fourth role in how the real
estate in China can add livability to a city. Meticulous property
management and services are representative characteristics of the
Chinese real estate. The hallmark of a “5-star” home must have
quality services from the threebaos
&ndash;janitors
(bao’jie), security guards
(bao’an), and maids
(bao’mu). Who thinks about where these
service staff might reside? They normally live in the basements,
between the pilotis, and on the rooftops of the elaborate real
estate developments they serve. How do they feel about working in
“5-star homes” in the day, and sleeping in its dark basements at
night? Prominent real estate developers are conscious about
building up their corporate responsibility image by committing to
charitable causes. However, if they can add value to the discourse
of affordable housing, if they can do their part in providing basic
housing for their service staff. It would not only fulfill their
social obligation as an employer, but it would bring about a closer
equilibrium in a society increasingly segmented by
class.

Emphasis on Quality of Life over Productivity
Lastly, there has to be an appreciation of new values and
a sustainable way of life.Before the
implementation of the Open Door policy, China had gone through a
period that emphasized production over quality of life, making no
progress in the improvements in housing and building construction.
By the 1990s, when China entered into an era of deregulated real
estate growth, the generation who grew up in either public
dormitories or commune compounds were unable to adapt to newer
notions of housing. The residents in transition were overwhelmed by
advertisements selling “5-star homes,” “mansions,” “Spanish-style
living,” “Parisian lifestyle,” “Florida town,” and so on. The
Chinese way of life as depicted by these advertisements are
markedly different from the actual way of life in genuinely livable
cities around the world. On one hand, these lifestyles worked with
the assumption of suburbanization, elitism through race and class
segregation, and an over-reliance on automobile travel as a
condition of modern convenience. It gave rise to materialist
attitudes, a lack of awareness in the exploitation of nature, and
unchecked and wasteful consumerism. On the other hand, one could
take the opportunity to build up newer values in well-planned
urbanization, diversity in the community, and a return to healthy
and smart bike travel. This can only lead to a more humanistic
attitude, a desire to protect the natural environment, and a
sensitivity towards the conservation of limited resources. Even
though real estate advertisements are often exaggerated and
misleading, the values espoused by the slogans can be used to
project effective and real changes.

Real Estate Mechanism in the Making of a Livable
City
It is crucial that architects and planning professionals
take the chance to reflect upon this divisive schism, and find ways
to narrow the differences. There are voices from the real estate
development sector arguing that the making of a livable city is the
government’s responsibility. Others lament that China is not at an
advanced enough stage to tackle such an issue. While governments
have an important role to play, and indeed, many cities in China
have set lofty goals to make their cities more livable, livability
of a city is not a concept for only developed countries. China can
use such a concept to speak to its latent potential in a projection
towards the future, especially after decades of rapid development
and utter destruction. That is to say, China is not livable at the
moment not because the nation is underdeveloped, but because the
notion of “livability” was ignorantly sacrificed during the process
of development. The mistakes made during the rapid construction of
China are difficult to correct because of an increased awareness of
property rights, and long periods of leases and master planning.
Only when all stakeholders and agencies related to urban
development have understood and accepted true and concrete ideas of
livability, can the city begin to move towards it. Without a doubt,
real estate development is an integral mechanism in the making of a
livable city.
