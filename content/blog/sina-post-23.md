看不见的城市：深双十年九面
Invisible Cities: 9 views of UABB by 10 years

创办于2005年的城市\建筑双城双年展（深圳）（简称深双），专门关注城市或城市化，十年五届，呈现出九方面需要重新认识和消化的特点：展示性、开放性、自发性、日常性、基础性、时间性、农业乡村、建筑、教育。
Founded in 2005, UABB, the Bi-city Biennale of
Urbanism\Architecture (Shenzhen), the only biennale focused on
urbanism/urbanization for about 10 years with 5 editions, has
revealed herself with 9 views which need to be recognized and
digested: city curating, openness, informal city, everyday life,
common ground, expiration, agriculture, architecture with context,
education.

1、
策展城市及触媒效应。这是深双区别于其它双年展的独特一面。深双保持与城市互动，甚至通过策展影响城市。其展场选择已成为一种具体策展／干预城市的策略，催化过期厂房转型再生，激发公共空间活力。
1. Curating city, or catalyst effect, makes UABB
as unique biennale. The curating and exhibition interacted with the
city through the venues strategy, catalyzed the transforming of
empty factory buildings, or activated the public spaces.

2、城市限制与开放是城市一对矛盾，也是深港特殊地缘关系的显著特点。首届与第五届深双分别以“城市，开门！”和“城市边缘”为主题，持续探讨了城市空间的、社会的、政策观念的各种边界／边缘议题及开放可能。
2. Openness and limit are dilemma of city, and
also the most specialties of Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Themed with
“City, Open Door!” and “City Border” from the 1st to
fifth, UABBs have discussed the crossing of special, social,
regulatory
boundaries.

3、自发城市是深双关注的以城中村为代表的城市自组织现象，涉及城市主体性和方法论问题：城市应由谁来决定和建设？市民个体是否有权利建设自己家园？自发性与精英规划是否是两种并存的、相互补充的造城模式？
3. Informal city is one kind of self-organizing
phenomenon, typically like Shenzhen urban villages, which UABBs
started researching since 2005. It raises the questions about
subjectivity and methodology: who decide and make city? Could
citizen individuals have rights to build their homes? Could
informal way be one of city-making model coexisting and mutual
complementing with elite top-down city planning?

4、衣食住行的城市日常生活是深双研讨和呈现城市问题的重要角度。人和城市的“穿衣戴帽”有何异同？城市如何养活自己？城市宜居如何实现起码的住得起和就近职住？影响城市形态及运作的交通如何更绿色高效？
4. Everyday life is also the important angle to
raise questions about city in UABBs. What are different between the
fashion/dressing up of people and the buildings? How to feed city?
How the livable city could be affordable with shortest commute?
Could mobility be more green and the car addition be
quit?

5、城市的共同基础包括了自然环境的、人造设施的、政策制度的和市民共识的。深双呈现的这些基础有可见有不可见，有不足有过度，有受侵害受忽略。城市共同基础要成为共同话题，共同协作设计，并纳入公共艺术视野。
5. The city common ground includes eco-system,
infrastructure, policies and consensus. UABB cared about the
problems in these fields, no matter visible or invisible, shortage
or oversupply, ignored or damaged, and advocated common discussion,
cooperative design and public art application.

6、城市生老病死指城市的有机性及其全生命周期。马清运策展的第二届深双提出“城市过期及再生”（简称CoER）主题，讨论了城市生命周期、机能退化与无能效，涉及城市更新与保护、农业启示与可持续发展等前沿话题。
The growth, oldness, illness and death of city,
means an organic and whole-life-cycle city. Qingyun Ma, curator of
2nd UABB, themed with “city expiration and
regeneration”, discussed the life cycle of city, degeneration and
inefficiency, in terms of cutting edge topics, like urban
regeneration and preservation, agriculture inspiration and
sustainability.

7、城市与乡村农业相互对立但又处于同一系统，不可避免被深双这一城市问题平台讨论，或称这是“一种希望或者是一种乌托邦式的标志”，专业者面对和服务乡村转型及变迁确实成为趋势。
7. Urban and rural/agriculture are unity of
opposites, had been discussed in UABB platform naturally. Someone
may say that was one kind of hope or symbol of utopia, but that’s
true that more and more professionals had faced and served the
transformation of rural in China.

8、城市建筑在深双名称中属于子目录，所以五届深双都在城市语境下探讨建筑，包括群体关系、地域性、社会性、临时性、轻结构等，这与当下中国城市建筑的标志性、高档化、“百年大计”、欧陆风、拆迁等构成了极端反差。
8. Architecture is the sub catalog of urbanism in
the name of UABB, so it had been talked under the context of city
in UABBs, about groups, regional, sociality, temporality, light
structure, etc. extremely contrast with the current building
situation in China which keywords are iconic, gentrification,
monumental, foreign clone style, relocation, etc.

9、学习城市指深双通过城市展览构建了一个关于城市知识的学习系统，强化了深圳学习型城市特征。借助这种多学科的、大型空间和公共艺术的活动方式，公众参与城市学习变得有趣和轻松，为共同参与建设宜居城市打下基础。
9. The learning city has been strengthened by UABB, through
the knowledge system composed from the content of exhibition
events, with interdisciplinary, high capacity and public art, made
the public participation more easily and interesting, laid a good
foundation for co-construction the livable
city.
